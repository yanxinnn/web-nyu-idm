    <h1 class="title">Once upon a freshman year...</h1>
    <p>'Twas</p>
    <p>my first</p>
    <p>year in high</p>
    <p>school and I</p>
    <p>thought that joining </p>
    <p>a sports team would be</p>
    <p>a great way to make some</p>
    <p>new friends. The sports offered</p>
    <p>by my high school in the fall included:</p>
    <p>soccer, volleyball, field hockey, cross country.</p>
    <p>As a rather uncoordinated person, I determined that</p>
    <p>my best bet would be cross country. After all, how hard</p>
    <p>could just running be? There would be no dangerous balls</p>
    <p>hurling at my face. Just me, prancing through the grass</p>
    <p>being one with nature, just like Bambi. It'd be so</p>
    <p>much fun. Oh, was I in for a surprise.</p>
