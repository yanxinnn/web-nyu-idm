    <h1 class="title">Once upon a freshman year...</h1>
    <p>It was my first year in high school and I thought joining a sports team would
    be a great way to make some new friends.</p>
    <p>The sports offered in the fall were:</p>
    <ul>Soccer</ul>
    <ul>Volleyball</ul>
    <ul>Field Hockey</ul>
    <ul>Cross Country</ul>
    <p>As a rather uncoordinated person, I determined that my best bet would be cross country.</p>
    <p>After all, how hard could just running be?</p>
    <p>There would be no dangerous balls hurling at my face. Just me, prancing through the grass,
        being one with nature, like</p>
    <div class="script">Bambi.</div>
    <p>It'd be so much fun.</p>
