  <p>I had a lot of thoughts of quitting, starting from the very first practice.</p>
  <p>During the runs, I told myself that this one would be my last. That I'd tell the coaches that I quit.</p>
  <p>But for some reason, I never did.</p>
  <p>Maybe it was because I loved the soreness and tiredness I felt after a run,</p>
  <p>the amount of ice cream I could eat without gaining weight</p>
  <p>the celebratory team sweets buffet after a race</p>
  <p>the confidence that I gained from being in shape.</p>
  <p>I started to run not to just survive the run, but to improve myself.</p>
  <p>It was so satisfying to see the fruits of my efforts and improving my personal best race times.
