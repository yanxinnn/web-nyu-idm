  <p>Sadly, the season did not get easier.</p>
  <p>I was not a Disney character prancing through a meadow of flowers.</p>
  <p>Rather, it was more on the lines of Darth Vadar breathing, sauna sweating, trying my best but my best wasn't good enough, kinda thing</p>
  <p>Everything only went uphill from here, which in normal terms isn't a bad thing.</p>
  <p>But this is cross country. And in cross country, hills are bad news.</p>
