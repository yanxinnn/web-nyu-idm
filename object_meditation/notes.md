Tall, slim, solid pink body, metal top, black handle

### feel like?
cold metal top, sticky rubbery handle, smooth body, metallic and reflective inside

### smell like?
nothing, though when you don't wash it for a few days the water in there might smell like a fishtank

### sound like?
echoes when you accidently swing it into something, water inside swooshes around when you move around with it

### Where did you get it?
I bought it on Amazon for cross country in high school

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
Cross country was a particularly challenging for me because I had never played a sport before competitively, the tag
days in the elementary school playgrounds don't count. It really tested me physically and mentally because during the miles that I was running, my body would feel like it was on fire and my muscles were about to give in. "I want to give up" was an ever present thought. After a while though, I started to see the fruits of my endeavors. I found myself
completing the miles faster as I practiced more and more. Races became less of a dread and more of an inviting challenge, beaconing me to do better than the race before it. After every practice and race, my water bottle was always
there waiting for me in the end to reward me with the sweet reward of rest and victory.

### Why did you choose it?
I chose it because it is something I always carry around with me to stay hydrated and it also serves as a token to
remind me of the time I survived cross country.

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
A lot of memories from my cross country days are attached to this. Everytime I'm going through a rough time, the memory
of my cross country days serve as a reminder that I am more capable than I may think I am and that I will make it
through.

### Is it one of a kind?
You could find so many water bottles, but this one has special memories attached

### How do you interact with it?
You drink out of it when you are thirsty, like any other water bottle. Twist the cap open to sip, then close.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with? Who are your objects friends?
My cross country spikes, Nike running shoes, my backpack, grass

### What is a specific memory you have with this object?
The first week of preseason was the absolute worst. I was so close to giving up and planned to quit after the first 3 days. We ran under the heat of the summer sun up grassy hills that sucked all the energy out of my sore legs. However, the team and coaches were very supportive and I learned to not compare my time with anyone else's but my own. I loved cross country, it was just the running part that kinda bothered me.
