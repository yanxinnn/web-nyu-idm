nothing, though when you don't wash it for a few days the water in there might smell like a fishtank

### sound like?
echoes when you accidently swing it into something, water inside swooshes around when you move around with it

### Where did you get it?
I bought it on Amazon for cross country in high school

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
Cross country was a particularly challenging for me because I had never played a sport before competitively, the tag
days in the elementary school playgrounds don't count. It really tested me physically and mentally because during the miles that I was running, my body would feel like it was on fire and muscles about to give in, and my thoughts would
always go to "I want to give up." 

### Why did you choose it?
I chose it because it is something I always carry around with me to stay hydrated

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
A lot of memories from my cross country days are attached to this

### Is it one of a kind?
You could find so many water bottles, but this one has particular memories attached to it

### How do you interact with it?
You drink out of it when you are thirsty, like any other water bottle

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with? Who are your objects friends?

### What is a specific memory you have with this object?
